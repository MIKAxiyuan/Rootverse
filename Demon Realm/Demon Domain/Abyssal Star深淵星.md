## Abyssal Star
- **Demon City**: Located in the northwest, this is the territory of the Slaughter Demons. The city is dry and desolate, set in a barren landscape. Its buildings are primarily constructed from obsidian and rock. The area around the city is covered in thick ash, creating an oppressive and powerful visual impact.
- **Shadow Tower City**: Situated in the central region, this city is built over a massive fissure, perpetually shrouded in a layer of dark clouds with dim lighting. The towering spires symbolize the Fallen Demons' pursuit of power and desire for conquest. The Gothic-style palace with its spires and eerie decorations serves as a warning to outsiders.
- **Abyss of Shadows**: Located in the north, this is a bottomless trench believed to be a gateway to the underworld. Legend has it that on full moon nights, strange lights emanate from the abyss.
- **Endless Canyon**: In the south, this winding and twisting canyon stretches for thousands of miles. It is the place where the Fallen Demons and the Slaughter Demons abandon their failures. The canyon hides unknown dangers and forgotten ancient secrets.
- **Netherwood**: In the southwest, this vast forest is a labyrinthine expanse covered in thick fog with twisted trees that block out the sky. Deeper within the forest lies the legendary "Spring of Souls," whose waters are said to possess incredible healing and power-enhancing properties.



## 深淵星
### 魔城
西北方，戮魔族的領地，這座城市乾燥、死寂，是一片荒蕪的土地，城市的建築材料多為黑曜石和岩石，魔城周圍鋪滿了厚厚的灰燼，給人一種壓抑而強大的視覺衝擊。

### 暗影塔城
中心區域，城市建造在巨大的裂隙之上，永遠被一層陰雲籠罩，光線昏暗。高聳的塔樓象徵著堕魔族對權力的追求與征服的欲望。堕魔王宮是城市的象徵，哥特式的尖塔和陰森裝飾是對外來者的一種警示。

### 暗影之淵
北部，這是一個深不見底的海溝，傳說是連接冥界的通道。據說，每當月圓之夜，淵中會有奇怪的光芒射出。

### 無盡峽谷
南部，峽谷蜿蜒曲折，伸展數千里，是堕魔族和缪魔族拋棄失敗者的地方，峽谷之中隱藏著不為人知的危險以及被遺忘的古老秘術。

### 幽冥林地
西南方，一片巨大的森林，林地錯綜複雜，覆蓋著厚厚的霧氣，樹木扭曲，幾乎看不見天光。在更深的森林中，有傳說中的“靈魂之泉”，據說那裡的水有著不可思議的治癒與功力增強效果。
